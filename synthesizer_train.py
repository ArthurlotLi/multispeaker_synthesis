# synthesizer_train.py
#
# Executes training of the synthesizer model. Allows user to 
# specify various aspects of the model training process. A
# prerequisite of running this process is pretrained speaker
# encoder model, as it will be used in a transfer learning
# configuration. 
#
# When these models are used, the speaker encoder used to 
# train the synthesizer model MUST be paired appropriately,
# otherwise the representation won't be interpreted correctly.
