Multispeaker Text To Speech Synthesis

Informed by state-of-the-art research into Multispeaker Text to Speech 
Synthesis [1]. A neural network-based system generating a waveform file
of speech given a few seconds of untranscribed reference audio from a target
speaker as well as the output text. Guided by code published by [2].

Contains three independently trained components:

1) Speaker Encoder - Provides a representation of speaker qualities having
   been trained on a separate Speaker Verification task. This fixed-dimensional
   vector is passed to (2).

2) Synthesis - Based on Tacotron 2; generates a log mel spectogram from input
   text conditioned by embedded speaker information provided by (1).

3) Vocoder - Given the log mel spectogram output by (2), generates the output 
   waveform file. Auto-regressive WaveNet-based. 

Datasets utilized:

VoxCeleb (1 and 2): https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/
